## Description

My motive for this project was to apply my javascript skills to a real problem. Shopping can be overwhelming and chaotic without a shopping list. Forgetting your paper list at home is even more frustrating. So, I created this application as a way to keep myself and others organized and stress free in the stores. 

## Learned
This whole project was made with vanilla javascript. This project allowed me to sharpen my skills related to the DOM, handling events, utilizing local storage and more. I gained a better understanding on dynamically creating, updating and removing elements using JS. With this app I got a great review of JS fundamentals.  

## Usage
How to Use:
- Add items to list using a form 
- Remove items from list by clicking the delete button
- Clear all items using the "clear" button
- Filter items to narrow down list, using the fitler field
- Uses localStorage to store content for user
- Enter "edit mode" by clicking the item wanted for editing and Update Item
